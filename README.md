# Dispersal-Ability_Speciation_Emberizoidea

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results obtained for "The effects of the dispersal ability in the diversification dynamics of Emberizoidea (Aves: Passeriformes)" draft.

It is divided in three self-contained directories, each one with a .pdf and a .Rmd, the pdf is a rendered version of the explained code that shows all the results, while the .Rmd is an editable and self reproducible code.

.Rmd files should run out of the box if the whole folder is downloaded and the code is repdroduced from there.

The folders are organized depending on the method they replicate.
 -QuaSSE folder: Using this code you can calculate the Quantitative State-dependent Speciation and Extinction models
 -Cor-Strates folder: Using this code you can replicate the "Correlated Speciation and Trait Rates simulations" frameworks
 -brms folder: Using this code you can perform the Multilevel Bayesian Regression Model
