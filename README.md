# Dispersal-Ability_Speciation_Emberizoidea

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results obtained for "The effects of the dispersal ability in the diversification dynamics of Emberizoidea (Aves: Passeriformes)" draft.

It is divided in three self-contained directories, each one with a .pdf and a .Rmd, the pdf is a rendered version of the explained code that shows all the results, while the .Rmd is an editable and self reproducible code.

.Rmd files should run out of the box if all the library is downloaded and the code is repdroduced from there.
